# Sam TypeScript MCP Server

It is generated with [Stainless](https://www.stainless.com/).

## Installation

### Via Claude Desktop

See [the user guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for setup.

Once it's set up, find your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following value to your `mcpServers` section. Make sure to provide any necessary environment variables (like API keys) as well.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sam_api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "git+ssh://git@github.com:DefinitelyATestOrg/sam-node.git:packages/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "My API Key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Filtering tools

You can run the package on the command line to discover and filter the set of tools that are exposed by the
MCP Server. This can be helpful for large APIs where including all endpoints at once is too much for your AI's
context window.

You can filter by multiple aspects:

- `--tool` includes a specific tool by name
- `--resource` includes all tools under a specific resource, and can have wildcards, e.g. `my.resource*`
- `--operation` includes just read (get/list) or just write operations

See more information with `--help`:

```sh
$ npx -y git+ssh://git@github.com:DefinitelyATestOrg/sam-node.git:packages/mcp-server --help
```

All of these command-line options can be repeated, combined together, and have corresponding exclusion versions (e.g. `--no-tool`).

Use `--list` to see the list of available tools, or see below.

## Available Tools

The following tools are available in this MCP server.

### Resource `messages`:

- `create_messages` (`write`): Send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, and the model will generate the next message in the conversation.

The Messages API can be used for either single queries or stateless multi-turn conversations.

Learn more about the Messages API in our [user guide](/en/docs/initial-setup)

- `count_tokens_messages` (`write`): Count the number of tokens in a Message.

The Token Count API can be used to count the number of tokens in a Message, including tools, images, and documents, without creating it.

Learn more about token counting in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/token-counting)

- `count_tokens_beta_messages` (`write`): Count the number of tokens in a Message.

The Token Count API can be used to count the number of tokens in a Message, including tools, images, and documents, without creating it.

Learn more about token counting in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/token-counting)

### Resource `messages.batches`:

- `create_messages_batches` (`write`): Send a batch of Message creation requests.

The Message Batches API can be used to process multiple Messages API requests at once. Once a Message Batch is created, it begins processing immediately. Batches can take up to 24 hours to complete.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

- `retrieve_messages_batches` (`read`): This endpoint is idempotent and can be used to poll for Message Batch completion. To access the results of a Message Batch, make a request to the `results_url` field in the response.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

- `list_messages_batches` (`read`): List all Message Batches within a Workspace. Most recently created batches are returned first.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

- `delete_messages_batches` (`write`): Delete a Message Batch.

Message Batches can only be deleted once they've finished processing. If you'd like to delete an in-progress batch, you must first cancel it.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

- `cancel_messages_batches` (`write`): Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.

The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.

- `results_messages_batches` (`read`): Streams the results of a Message Batch as a `.jsonl` file.

Each line in the file is a JSON object containing the result of a single request in the Message Batch. Results are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

### Resource `complete`:

- `create_complete` (`write`): [Legacy] Create a Text Completion.

The Text Completions API is a legacy API. We recommend using the [Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages) going forward.

Future models and features will not be compatible with Text Completions. See our [migration guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/migrating-from-text-completions-to-messages) for guidance in migrating from Text Completions to Messages.

### Resource `models`:

- `retrieve_models` (`read`): Get a specific model.

The Models API response can be used to determine information about a specific model or resolve a model alias to a model ID.

- `list_models` (`read`): List available models.

The Models API response can be used to determine which models are available for use in the API. More recently released models are listed first.

- `retrieve_beta_models` (`read`): Get a specific model.

The Models API response can be used to determine information about a specific model or resolve a model alias to a model ID.
